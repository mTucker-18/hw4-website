       <p>Hello!  My name is Matthew Tucker and I am currently  a student of __KickStart Coding__.  I am also a marine biologist and a political operative.  I believe that people in every profession need to know how to code because we are increasingly a computer-dominated society.  That is why I am trying to add coding to my repertoire of skills, **and you should too**!  I can’t imagine a field biologist in Kenya not making use of graphical modeling skills to make her research accessible to colleagues.  I don’t know how a school board candidate would efficiently contact his constituents without using database management skills.  And I want every student who graduates high school to know how to make a website like this one in order to more effectively reach their goal of a meaningful career.</p>
       <p>Here are a few of my favorite things: My favorite president is <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/4i7NPjT" target="_blank">William Howard Taft</a>.  My favorite fictional creature is the Green Man from Wheel of Time.  My favorite creature in our version of reality is the <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/fXeU0dk" target="_blank">octopus</a>.  My favorite feeling is surprise and my favorite elbow is <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/P4Si8" target="_blank">Tilda Swinton’s</a> left (heavily featured in Dr. Strange and Constantine).</p>
