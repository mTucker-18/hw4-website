       <p>Aside from trying to craft a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOggf3hq_M8" target="_blank">Legendary Weapon</a>, my biggest project right now is learning to code. It takes a lot of effort and a re-wiring of the brain. But luckily I am not alone! </p>
 	   <p>At __KickStart Coding__ we meet every week to learn about various coding languages, do in-class activities and discuss the philosophy behind the developer field.</p> 
 	   <p>You don't have to quit your job, because we learn in the evenings and on the weekend! And taking this course wont break the bank either.</p>
	   <p>Here is a list of what we have learned so far:</p>
	   * HTML
	   * CSS
	   * Bash
	   * Git
	   * Python
	   * GitHub
	   * HTTP
	   * Markdown
	   * Jinja
	   * Django

	   <p>I'm a pretty big noob. When it comes to coding, I need a lot more practice if I am going to create anything of substance. Luckily most coders are super nerdy, so there are fun games that will help me out.</p>
